# fuzzy-match

A Graphical User Interface (GUI) that matches Names and IDs across different CSV files based Fuzzy String Matching techniques.

This is a modified version of a tool I created in my internship, to help with the reconcilliation of conflicting HR data across different spreadsheets (based on name and unqiue user IDs).
